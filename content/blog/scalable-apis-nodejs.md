# Building Scalable APIs with Node.js

Node.js has become the go-to platform for building fast, scalable APIs. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it perfect for handling high-concurrency scenarios. Let's explore how to build APIs that can scale.

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Layered Architecture
Separate your concerns into distinct layers:

```
├── controllers/     # Handle HTTP requests
├── services/        # Business logic
├── repositories/    # Data access
└── models/         # Data structures
```

### 2. Microservices
Break your application into small, focused services:

- **User Service**: Handle authentication and user management
- **Order Service**: Process and manage orders
- **Notification Service**: Send emails and push notifications

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimization
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper indexing
- Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

```javascript
// Connection pooling with Postgres
const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
  max: 20,
  idleTimeoutMillis: 30000,
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 2000,
});
```

### Caching Strategies
- **In-memory caching** with Redis
- **CDN** for static assets
- **Database query caching**

### Load Balancing
Distribute traffic across multiple server instances:

```javascript
// Using cluster module
const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  require('./app');
}
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Implement comprehensive monitoring:
- **Application metrics**: Response times, error rates
- **Business metrics**: API usage, user activity  
- **Infrastructure metrics**: CPU, memory, disk usage

Building scalable APIs is about making smart architectural decisions early and continuously monitoring performance as you grow.
